# Portfolio
Examples of my work, including screenshots and coding samples. 

Please note that some of this work is not actually on this GitHub as it is from my Summer 2015 internship. These screenshots of Android applications are not hosted here due to the fact that although I received permission to take and show these screenshots to recruiters, I do not wish to make them publicly accessible. Please ask to see these screenshots.
